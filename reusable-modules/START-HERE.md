# 🎁 For Your Friend - Getting Started

Hey! This package contains everything you need to add authentication, payments, and database to your Next.js app. Here's how to use it.

## 🎯 What You're Getting

**3 Complete Modules** that work together:

3. **🗄️ Supabase DB** - Database, file storage, queries

All modules are:
- ✅ Production-ready code from real app
- ✅ Fully documented with examples
- ✅ Easy copy-paste integration

## 🚀 Step-by-Step for Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create Accounts (5 min)
1. Sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) - Free
2. Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) - Free (test mode)
3. Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) - Free

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (1 min)
```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs @stripe/stripe-js stripe @supabase/supabase-js svix
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables (2 min)
Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your keys.

```env
# Get these from each service dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
# ... etc
```

### Step 4: Copy Files (3 min)
```bash
# Copy all module files to your project
cp -r 1-clerk-auth/lib/* your-app/lib/
cp -r 2-stripe-payments/lib/* your-app/lib/
cp -r 3-supabase-storage/lib/* your-app/lib/
# ... copy other needed files
```

### Step 5: Run Database Setup (2 min)
Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- Copy from: 3-supabase-storage/sql/schema.sql
-- Then run: 3-supabase-storage/sql/rls-policies.sql
```

### Step 6: Configure Webhooks (2 min)
- Clerk: Dashboard → Webhooks → Add `your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
- Stripe: Dashboard → Webhooks → Add `your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

### Step 7: Test! (5 min)
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Try sign-up, payments, data storage
```

**Total: 20 minutes and you're live! 🎉**

## 🎓 Understanding the Code

### Authentication Flow
```
User visits /sign-up
  ↓
Clerk handles signup
  ↓
Webhook creates user in Supabase
  ↓
User can access protected routes
```

### Payment Flow
```
User selects plan on /pricing
  ↓
Stripe checkout created
  ↓
User pays
  ↓
Webhook updates subscription
  ↓
User gets premium access
```

### Database Flow
```
API route needs data
  ↓
Uses Supabase client
  ↓
Row Level Security checks
  ↓
Returns user's data only
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Clerk (Authentication)
- Handles all user management
- Provides secure sessions
- Webhooks notify your app of changes

### Stripe (Payments)
- Creates checkout pages
- Manages subscriptions
- Webhooks notify payment events

### Supabase (Database)
- PostgreSQL database
- Row Level Security (users see only their data)
- Real-time subscriptions possible

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

### Change Pricing Plans
Edit `2-stripe-payments/lib/stripe-config.ts`:
```typescript
export const STRIPE_PLANS = {
  BASIC: { price: 9.99, ... },
  PRO: { price: 29.99, ... },
  // Add your own plans
}
```

### Add Database Tables
Edit `3-supabase-storage/sql/schema.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE your_table (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  -- your columns
);
```

### Customize Auth Pages
Edit `1-clerk-auth/app/sign-in/page.tsx`:
```tsx
<SignIn 
  appearance={{
    // Your custom styles
  }}
/>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Webhook not working"
- Check URL is publicly accessible
- Verify webhook secret matches
- Check logs in service dashboard

### "Database query failed"
- Use `supabaseAdmin` in API routes
- Check RLS policies allow access
- Verify table exists

### "Payment not updating"
- Check Stripe webhook is configured
- Verify webhook handler runs
- Check Supabase for updates
