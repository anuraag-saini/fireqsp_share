## 🔒 SECURITY HARDENING (Priority 1)

**Status:** 🟢 Nearly Complete  
**Target Completion:** Sept 30, 2025

### Database Security
- [ ] **Enable RLS on all tables**
  - [x] ✅ `interactions` table RLS policy (implemented and optimized)
  - [x] ✅ `extractions` table RLS policy (implemented and optimized)
  - [x] ✅ `extraction_jobs` table RLS policy (implemented and optimized)  
  - [x] ✅ `user_subscriptions` table RLS policy (implemented and optimized)
  - [x] ✅ `user_usage` table RLS policy (implemented and optimized)
  - [x] ✅ `system_settings` - Admin-only RLS policy created
  - [x] ✅ `admin_activities` table RLS policy (admin-only access)
  - **Notes:** All core tables now have optimized RLS policies

- [ ] **RLS Performance Optimization (CRITICAL)**
  - [x] ✅ Fixed `((auth.uid())::text = user_id)` → `(user_id = (select auth.uid()::text))`
  - [x] ✅ Fixed `(extraction_id IN (SELECT...))` → optimized pattern
  - **Affected Tables:** `extractions`, `user_subscriptions`, `user_usage`, `extraction_jobs`, `interactions`
  - **Result:** Eliminated row-by-row auth function re-evaluation

- [ ] **Admin Activity Logging (Missing)**
  - [ ] 🟡 Add logging calls to `/api/admin/settings/route.ts`
  - [ ] 🟡 Log system_settings changes and user access grants
  - **Issue:** admin-logger.ts exists but not used in settings API

- [ ] **Function Security Hardening**
  - [x] ✅ Set `search_path` parameter on `remove_duplicate_interactions` function
  - [x] ✅ Removed unused functions (`update_vote_count`, `update_updated_at_column`)
  - **Result:** Prevented potential injection attacks

- [ ] **Database Cleanup**
  - [x] ✅ Removed all community table policies
  - [x] ✅ Removed community tables and triggers
  - [ ] 🔲 Manual deletion of remaining `community_methods` table
  - **Result:** Eliminated duplicate policy warnings and performance overhead

- [ ] **Database Version Security**
  - [ ] 🟡 Upgrade Postgres version to apply security patches
  - **Current:** supabase-postgres-17.4.1.064
  - **Issue:** Outstanding security patches available

**Security Action Items:**
1. [x] ✅ **COMPLETED:** `database/policies/01_system_settings_admin_policy.sql` - Admin dashboard restored
2. [x] ✅ **COMPLETED:** `database/policies/02_optimize_rls_performance.sql` - Performance issues fixed
3. [x] ✅ **COMPLETED:** `database/policies/03_cleanup_community_policies.sql` - Policies removed
4. [x] ✅ **COMPLETED:** `database/policies/05_complete_community_cleanup.sql` - Complete community removal
5. [ ] 🔲 **Manual:** Drop remaining `community_methods` table
6. [ ] 🟡 **Medium Priority:** Add admin activity logging to settings API route

**Database Organization:**
- [x] ✅ Created `database/migrations/` folder structure
- [x] ✅ Created `database/policies/` folder for security fixes
- [x] ✅ Moved existing migration files to organized structure
- [x] ✅ Created SQL scripts for immediate security fixes
