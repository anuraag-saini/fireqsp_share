## Platform Positioning for Conference

### Opening Introduction
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name]. I'm a QSP modeler with 10+ years experience who's building an AI platform specifically for oncology QSP workflows. I really enjoyed your presentation on [topic] - it relates to challenges I've faced in cancer modeling."

### Platform Concept (30-second pitch)
"After years of oncology QSP work, I decided to build FireQSP - a platform that provides cancer-specific literature intelligence and parameter estimation. Instead of adapting general AI tools, it's designed specifically for oncology modeling workflows."

## Session-Specific Validation Strategies

### Session 1 & 2: Clinical Applications
**Target:** Denise Feick (Sanofi), Cleo Demeester (KU Leuven), Manuel Ibarra (Udelar)

**Validation Focus:** Regulatory and clinical workflow challenges
- "How do you handle literature documentation for oncology submissions?"
- "Are there cancer-specific parameter challenges not addressed by general PBPK tools?"
- "Would oncology-focused literature analysis add value to your current workflow?"

### Session 3: Research & Discovery  
**Target:** Gregori Gerebtzoff (Novartis), Andrea Gruber (Bayer), René Geci (UK Aachen)

**Validation Focus:** AI/ML integration and discovery workflows
- "You're using ML with mechanistic modeling - have you tried AI for oncology literature analysis?"
- "What role does cancer-specific literature play in your discovery modeling?"
- "Would you pay premium for oncology-specialized vs general AI tools?"

### Session 5: QSP & PD (Most Critical)
**Target:** Stephan Schaller (ESQlabs), Erik Sjögren (Uppsala), Donato Teutonico (Sanofi)

**Validation Focus:** QSP ecosystem integration and workflow
- "I'm building oncology-specific QSP tools - what OSP Suite integration would be most valuable?"
- "How do you currently handle cancer-specific parameter estimation in your QSP models?"
- "What gaps do you see in current QSP workflow tools for oncology applications?"

## Key Validation Questions

### Oncology Specialization Value
1. "Do you work specifically in oncology QSP, or across therapeutic areas?"
2. "What makes oncology modeling different from other therapeutic areas?"
3. "Would cancer-specific parameter databases be more valuable than general biological data?"

### Current Workflow Pain Points  
4. "What takes the most time in your oncology literature analysis?"
5. "How do you currently handle drug resistance mechanisms in your models?"
6. "What's your biggest challenge in oncology parameter estimation?"

### Platform Integration Needs
7. "What software ecosystem integration would be critical for adoption?"
8. "How important is regulatory documentation automation for your work?"
9. "What would make you consider switching from current tools?"

### Business Validation
10. "What's your team's budget for specialized QSP software?"
11. "Who makes decisions about new tool purchases?"
12. "How do you justify ROI for research productivity tools?"
