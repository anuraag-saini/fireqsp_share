Hi [Name],

I noticed your oncology QSP work at [Company]. I'm a fellow QSP modeler building an AI platform specifically for cancer modeling workflows.

### Interview Request (Post-Connection)
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! I'm reaching out because I'm building FireQSP, an AI platform specifically for oncology QSP workflows, and would really value insights from experienced oncology modelers.

I'm conducting 30-minute calls with QSP professionals to understand cancer modeling challenges and validate the problems I'm solving. As a thank you, I provide a $50 Amazon gift card.

Topics would include:
- Current approach to oncology literature analysis and parameter estimation
- Cancer-specific challenges vs general QSP modeling
- Tools and workflow pain points in oncology projects

Would you be interested in a brief call next week?

Best regards,
