# Oncology QSP Platform - Customer Interview Script

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Incentive:** $50 Amazon gift card  
**Focus:** Validate oncology-specific QSP platform need

---

## Introduction (5 minutes)

"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name], a QSP modeler with 10+ years experience who's building an AI platform specifically for oncology QSP workflows. After working at Vantage Research and in pharma, I decided to create the oncology-focused tool I always wished existed.

This is research, not sales - I want to understand how other QSP professionals approach oncology modeling challenges. Your insights will help me build something that actually solves real problems.

Can I record for notes, or prefer written notes only?"

**Background:**
1. Your role and current oncology QSP projects?
2. What cancer types do you focus on?  
3. Size of your QSP team and your role within it?

## Oncology QSP Workflow Challenges (20 minutes)

### Literature & Parameter Estimation
4. **"What's your current process for oncology literature analysis?"**
   - Cancer-specific databases vs general literature?
   - Time spent on literature review per oncology project?
   - Biggest frustrations with finding oncology parameters?

5. **"How do you handle parameter estimation for cancer populations?"**
   - Different approaches for different cancer types?
   - How do you deal with sparse oncology data?
   - Process for drug resistance mechanism modeling?

6. **"What makes oncology QSP modeling different from other therapeutic areas?"**
   - Unique challenges vs general drug development?
   - Cancer-specific considerations in your models?

### Current Tools & Pain Points
7. **"What tools do you use for oncology literature analysis?"**
   - Any AI tools (Causaly, nference) for cancer research?
   - Satisfaction level with current approaches?
   - Specific gaps in oncology coverage?

8. **"What takes the most time in your oncology QSP workflow?"**
9. **"If you could eliminate one bottleneck in oncology modeling, what would it be?"**

## Platform Concept Validation (10 minutes)

"I'm building FireQSP, an AI platform specifically for oncology QSP workflows that would:
- Extract cancer-specific PK/PD parameters with confidence scoring
- Analyze drug resistance mechanisms and timelines  
- Integrate with OSP Suite and other QSP software
- Provide regulatory-ready documentation for oncology submissions"

10. **"Does this address real problems in your oncology work?"**
11. **"Would cancer-specific intelligence be more valuable than general biological data?"**
12. **"What integration with your current software would be essential?"**
13. **"What concerns about AI tools in regulated oncology environments?"**

## Business Validation (8 minutes)

### Budget & Decision Making
14. **"Annual budget for QSP software and specialized tools?"**
15. **"Who decides on new tool purchases for oncology projects?"**
16. **"How do you justify specialized tool investments?"**

### Pricing & Value
17. **"Would you pay premium for oncology-specific vs general platforms?"**
    - Individual license ($500-750/month) vs team license ($2500-4000/month)?
18. **"What would drive switching from current oncology analysis methods?"**

---

## Competitive Intelligence (5 minutes)

19. **"Experience with general AI platforms (Causaly, nference) for oncology work?"**
20. **"What would make an oncology-specific platform more valuable?"**
21. **"Must-have vs nice-to-have features for oncology QSP work?"**
