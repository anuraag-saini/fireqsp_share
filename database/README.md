## Usage Guidelines

### For New Migrations
Place new schema changes in `migrations/` with numbered prefixes:
- Format: `XX_descriptive_name.sql`
- Include rollback instructions in comments

### For New Policies  
Place new security policies in `policies/` folder:
- Use clear naming conventions
- Include verification queries
- Document the security purpose

### Archive Policy
- Move completed one-time fixes to `archive/`
- Keep migration scripts in `migrations/` (they may be needed for rebuilds)
- Preserve documentation for audit trails
