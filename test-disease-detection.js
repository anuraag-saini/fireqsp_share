Analyze the provided scientific text and identify the primary disease or medical condition being studied.

Look for:
- Disease names (e.g., "diabetes", "inflammatory bowel disease", "cancer", "Alzheimer's")
- Medical conditions or syndromes
- Pathological states
- Drug targets or therapeutic areas

Return ONLY the disease name as a simple string. Examples:
- "Diabetes"
- "Inflammatory Bowel Disease" 
- "Cancer"
- "Alzheimer's Disease"
- "Cardiovascular Disease"
- "Obesity"

If no clear disease can be identified, return "General".
If multiple diseases are mentioned, return the primary one being studied.
